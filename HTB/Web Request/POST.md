# POST

In the previous section, we saw how `GET` requests may be used by web applications for functionalities like search and accessing pages. However, whenever web applications need to transfer files or move the user parameters from the URL, they utilize `POST` requests.

Unlike HTTP `GET`, which places user parameters within the URL, HTTP `POST` places user parameters within the HTTP Request body. This has three main benefits:

- `Lack of Logging`: As POST requests may transfer large files (e.g. file upload), it would not be efficient for the server to log all uploaded files as part of the requested URL, as would be the case with a file uploaded through a GET request.
- `Less Encoding Requirements`: URLs are designed to be shared, which means they need to conform to characters that can be converted to letters. The POST request places data in the body which can accept binary data. The only characters that need to be encoded are those that are used to separate parameters.
- `More data can be sent`: The maximum URL Length varies between browsers (Chrome/Firefox/IE), web servers (IIS, Apache, nginx), Content Delivery Networks (Fastly, Cloudfront, Cloudflare), and even URL Shorteners (bit.ly, amzn.to). Generally speaking, a URL's lengths should be kept to below 2,000 characters, and so they cannot handle a lot of data.

So, let's see some examples of how POST requests work, and how we can utilize tools like cURL or browser devtools to read and send POST requests.
