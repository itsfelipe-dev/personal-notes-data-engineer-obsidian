**Hbase**

Apache HBase is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.
It is well suited for real-time data processing or random read/write access to large volumes of data.

Use Apache HBaseâ„¢ when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database

 big table designed to provide quick random access to huge amounts of structured data. 

Apache HBase enables low-latency reads from, and writes to, tables that can grow to millions of columns and billions of rows in size. This allows it to store and serve data from high-performance applications, such as those involving event monitoring, detection, and prediction. Although it may be used in conjunction with machine learning, it doesn't provide implementations of machine learning algorithms, as those are typically provided by other tools, such as Apache Spark. While Cloudera's platform does provide support for parsing and indexing unstructured text data in more than 30 human languages, this capability comes from Apache Solr, the main component behind Cloudera Search.
