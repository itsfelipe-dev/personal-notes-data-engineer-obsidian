 Apache Atlas is a highly performing metadata service, which gathers metadata from different services across the platform
1.  and is aware of the changes happening to metadata across different services and the objects within them.
2.  So for example we have built-in connectivity to Hive, Impala, Spark and other services across the ecosystem.
3.  And as in when changes happen that our agents that capture all the changes to the metadata and push that in to the atlas metadata service in a scalable fashion.
4.  Apache Atlas because of all of the metadata connectivity has across the ecosystem gives you a central place to look at
5.  cataloging all of these assets and understanding the properties of these assets and how they relate to different operations you might have within your ecosystem.
